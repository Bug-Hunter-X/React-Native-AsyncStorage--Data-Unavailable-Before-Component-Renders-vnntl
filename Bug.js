This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been fully initialized. In React Native, components mount and update asynchronously, meaning that the state or prop values might not be immediately available when your component renders for the first time. This usually happens when you're trying to use a prop or state value in the render method before the component has fully received its props or the state has been updated.
