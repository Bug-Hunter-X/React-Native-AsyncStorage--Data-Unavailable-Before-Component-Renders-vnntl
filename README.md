# React Native AsyncStorage: Data Unavailable Before Component Renders

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications where data from AsyncStorage is accessed before it's fully loaded.  The provided example showcases how to fix this problem by properly handling asynchronous operations.

## Problem

When using AsyncStorage in a React Native component, it's crucial to ensure that the data has been retrieved before attempting to access it.  Failure to do so will lead to undefined values, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `useEffect` hook and the `async/await` syntax to ensure the data is loaded before rendering the component.  This approach correctly handles asynchronous operations and prevents errors related to accessing undefined values.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-native-asyncstorage-error.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd react-native-asyncstorage-error`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Run the app: `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
